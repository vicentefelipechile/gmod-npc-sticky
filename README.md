# GMod NPC Sticky

This addon for Garry's Mod allows you to "stick" or weld NPCs to moving objects. If an object moves, the "stuck" NPC will move along with it, maintaining its relative position.

## How to use?

To enable NPCs to be "stuck" to objects, you need to go to:

    Spawnmenu > Utilities > Sticky NPCs > Options

And finally, check the box to activate it (Only the host of the game or server can do this).
